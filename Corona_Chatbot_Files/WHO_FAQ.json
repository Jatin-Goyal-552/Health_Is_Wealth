 {
  "Context": "What is a coronavirus?",
  "Answer": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "What is a coronavirus?",
  "Answer": "In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases"
 },
 {
  "Context": "What is COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
 },
 {
  "Context": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually."
 },
 {
  "Context": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment."
 },
 {
  "Context": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
 },
 {
  "Context": "How does COVID-19 spread?",
  "Answer": "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "How does COVID-19 spread?",
  "Answer": "People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
 },
 {
  "Context": "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?",
  "Answer": "Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?",
  "Answer": "The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low."
 },
 {
  "Context": "Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?",
  "Answer": "Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?",
  "Answer": "The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. "

 {
  "Context": "How likely am I to catch COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there."
 },
 {
  "Context": "How likely am I to catch COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher."
 },
 {
  "Context": "How likely am I to catch COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go."
 },
 {
  "Context": "Should I worry about COVID-19",
  "Answer": "Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care."
 },
 {
  "Context": "Should I worry about COVID-19",
  "Answer": "We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities."
 },
 {
  "Context": "Who is at risk of developing severe illness?",
  "Answer": "While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?",

  "Answer": "Smoking products such as water pipes often involve the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 in communal and social settings."
 },
 {
  "Context": "How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?",
  "Answer": "High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings."
 },
 {
  "Context": "How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?",
  "Answer": "An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. "
 },
 {
  "Context": "Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?",
  "Answer": "No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. "
